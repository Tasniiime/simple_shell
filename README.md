# Simple Shell

- A simple shell project in C Programming. It is a basic implementation of a Unix shell. It interprets commands entered by a user and executes programs based on those simple commands. It is meant to provide a basic interface for using the operating system.

## Key Features

- It executes commands in both interactive and non-interactive mode.
- The shell includes built-in commands such as exit, env, setenv, unsetenv, and cd, among others.
- It handles command lines with arguments.
- It supports environment variable expansion and updating.
- It allows custom implementation of getline for input handling.
- Simple shell implements error handling similar to sh (/bin/sh).

## Installation

- To install and run this project, clone this repository from GitHub to your local computer `git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple_shell.git`
- Navigate via terminal to the project directory `cd simple_shell`. Compile the project with the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`, and run the program  with `./hsh`.
- You can try out various shell commands interactively and probably extend the functionalities.

## Future Advancements

The project is just a basic beginning. More features will be added to the shell later.
